# Triste

## Proposal

This project proposal aims to delve deeply into the game Tetris, focusing on two essential aspects. Firstly, it involves faithfully recreating the game Tetris and conducting an in-depth analysis of its functioning, design, and history. Secondly, this project seeks to develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) capable of mastering Tetris to the extent of never losing.

The first part of the project entails a meticulous analysis of Tetris, breaking down its mechanics, design principles, and historical evolution. This analysis will shed light on the elements that have contributed to making Tetris an enduring cultural phenomenon and explain its consistent appeal.

The second component of the project is equally fascinating, involving the development of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system that can achieve exceptional mastery of Tetris, avoiding losses altogether. By creating an AI capable of surpassing human-like strategic thinking and adaptability within the Tetris environment, we aim to push the boundaries of AI capabilities and explore potential applications of this technology in the realms of gaming, problem-solving, and AI research.
